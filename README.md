# M220 MFlix UI Front-End

Hi there,

In this repository you can find the [MongoDB University Developer Courses](https://university.mongodb.com/)
front-end application.

The code is made available, so you can explore how MFlix application was created and how it is used throughout the M220 online courses.

All validation codes have been striped out of the source code  so you have the
opportunity to the M220 learning experience in full!

The MFlix UI is a React Application that performs backend request via
a backend exposed Rest API.

## Local build

If you want to make modifications, debug or simply just create a local version
of the MFlix front-end you can do so by building locally.

### Dependencies

To run the MFlix UI application locally you need to have the following
dependencies:

- ``npm`` 6.4.1 or above
- ``node`` v10.6.0 or above
- Local ``mflix`` backend

### Local Installation

- 1) Install application dependencies

```sh
cd mflix-ui
npm install
```

- 2) Run the front-end server

```sh
npm start
```

Once you've started the server, you should be redirected to http://localhost:3000

Enjoy!
